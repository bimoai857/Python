madlib=f"I would like to say a few {adjective1} words about the \
         most important invention of the twentieth century, I am not \
         referring to {an_invention} or even to the discovery of \
         {a_food}. The most {adjective2} invention, in my opinion, \
          is the sneaker. If it were not for sneakers, our {part_of_body_plural}\
          would be dirty, cold, and  {adjective3}. Sneakers keep me from skidding \
            if the {plural_noun1} are slippery, and when I run, they keep me from stubbing\
            my {plural_noun2}."
